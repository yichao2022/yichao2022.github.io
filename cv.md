### **Research Interests**

- Behavioral Economics: Intertemporal decision-making, time preference
  estimation, and hyperbolic discounting models.
- Public Health: Vaccination uptake, health policy design, and pandemic
  preparedness for pandemics.
- Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs): Survey design, attribute-level
  balance, and applications in health and social sciences.
- Data Analysis: Mixed logit models, machine learning optimization
  (e.g., gradient descent), and fractional factorial designs.

PAPERS UNDER REVIEW & WORKING PAPERS

**Tian, Z.**, Xiang, Y., & **Jin, Y.** (Under review). *How CEO Succession Influences Firm AI Innovation: The Role of Academic Experience Changes.* *Journal of Business Research*.

> Analyzes 1,776 CEO succession events in Chinese high-tech firms to examine how shifts in CEOs' academic experience impact AI innovation.

> Findings suggest that transitions to academic CEOs significantly enhance AI innovation, moderated by TMT digital expertise and regional knowledge ecosystems.

**Jin, Y.**, & Kim, D. (Under review). *How Humans Value Delayed Protection: Biological Vulnerability and Intertemporal Health Decisions.* Target Journal: *Economic Analysis and Policy* (Elsevier).

> Utilizes a DCE with 1000+ respondents in Wuhan, China, to estimate
> hyperbolic and exponential discount rates for CLD vaccination
> decisions.

> Highlights the role of biological vulnerability (age, chronic conditions) in shaping time preferences and derives equity-sensitive policy rules.

RESEARCH PIPELINE

Behavioral Elasticities of Early Vaccination Incentives

Develops structural simulation tools to estimate incentive elasticity of
early vaccination, integrating MWTA/WTW and iso-uptake surfaces.

### **Time Preferences in Preventive Health: A Multi-Domain Behavioral Study**

Explores whether impatience is domain-specific across vaccination, mask
acquisition, and antiviral adoption.

### **AI-Assisted Behavioral Forecasting (SHARP + Stanford AI Certificate Integration)**

Combines DCE results with machine-learning forecasting to identify
high-discount subgroups for targeted public-health intervention.
